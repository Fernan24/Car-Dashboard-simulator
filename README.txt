Read this to ensure that you run the program correctly. 

This program is meant to simulate a car’s dash board that displays fuel of the tank, rpms, velocity (in this case the simulator doesn’t indicate velocity directly). The wheel will not spin if the fuel tank is empty. To make the wheel spin there are two buttons to control acceleration and deceleration. a message will be displayed when max acceleration is reached and also a different one will be displayed when the fuel tank is at maximum capacity.

To run this program from the terminal the first thing you have to do is extract the contents of the zip file.

In this case i’m going to asume you saved the file in desktop. I will also asume that you have already installed the JDK (java development kit). If you don’t have there please proceed to java.sun.com and download the JDK and make sure this program’s file is saved on your desktop.

After you have verified the pre conditions stated above the procedure described below should work:

	1)Open terminal.
	2)Write “ls” and hit enter to list the contents of the directory you are in. (note never to write the quotation marks ”” this is only to clarify what you have to write, only write what is between the quotation marks).
	3)Make sure that the desktop is included in the list. if not please go to the internet to find why it is not appearing.
	4)Write “cd Desktop” and hit enter.
	5)Write “ls” and hit enter.
	6)The file name P2_802137210 should appear on the list. Write “cd P2_802137210”.
	7)write “ls” and hit enter.
	8)The file name src should be listed. Write “cd src” and hit enter.
	9)write “ls” and hit enter.  
	10)The MainExecution.java should be listed. Write “javac MainExecution.java” to compile the program and hit enter.
	11)After compiling it there should not be any errors assuming you followed the instructions carefully, now write “java MainExecution” to run the program.
	12)A window will open with the Graphic User Interface or GUI and you can start manipulating the program. 
	13)Make sure to add fuel to accelerate or decelerate or that at least there is some fuel left. In this case every 4 rotations corresponds to the use of one liter of a 60 liter fuel tank.
